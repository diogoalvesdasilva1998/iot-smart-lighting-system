# iot-smart-lighting-system
This repository contains the source code and flow files for a smart IoT-based lighting system designed to optimize energy consumption by dynamically adjusting the brightness of a Tapo L530E smart lamp. The system uses real-time sensor data (light intensity) and a mobile app interface for monitoring and control.
